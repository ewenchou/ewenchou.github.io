I've been interested with the Raspberry Pi since the original was released back in 2012. Every now-and-then a Pi project shows up in my Twitter or RSS feed and they're always so cool! They usually land in two camps, the easy-to-achieve (e.g. [retro gaming system](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-retro-game-console-498561192), [HTPC systems](http://kodi.wiki/view/Raspberry_Pi)) and the not-so-easy (e.g. [magic mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/)).

The dilemma I had (personally) was:

1. The easy-to-achieve didn't *really* require a Pi. I had enough computers at home to do the same things -- and do them better.
2. The not-so-easy projects were super cool! But they all required some level of craftsmanship or electrical know-how that I simply am not comfortable with (yet? maybe?).

So the Pi remained something fun that I kept in the back of my mind.

This time though, I guess the stars aligned just right. Our family had recently jumped onto the [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/prime/) band-wagon. And of course the only proper way to celebrate such a thing was to buy stuff that are great deals but maybe we don't really *need* :P

And as it so happens, a Raspberry Pi starter kit was on sale. How could I resist? My wife was super-supportive, even though I totally failed at explaining to her what's a Raspberry Pi.
