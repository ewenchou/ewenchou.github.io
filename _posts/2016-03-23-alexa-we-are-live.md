A bit of foreshadowing here (as I haven't reached this part in my posts yet), but I've been learning and working on a few [Alexa Skills](https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit) for my Raspberry Pi project.

I got the certification approval email late last night, and the skill is now live on the [Amazon Alexa app](http://alexa.amazon.com)!

This skill isn't related to my Raspberry Pi project at all, but was a result of learning ASK and going through the full development and certification process.

I had a lot of fun building it, and hope that others will have fun using it with their Alexa devices too :)

Just search for *Hearthstone* in the *Skills* section and enable it.
